Laboratory:
Haematology
Specimen type:
Gel Serum (Brown top)
Special requirements and comments:
Requests should be received by the laboratory within 8 hours of phlebotomy, add on tests within 24 hours
of phlebotomy.
Relevant Clinical Details required.
General principles
1. Measurement of vitamin B12, folate or ferritin should only be performed following clinical
assessment, and in the presence of one of the specific indications listed below.
2. Fatigue and tiredness are not indications for vitamin B12, folate or ferritin measurement.
3. Vitamin B12, folate and ferritin testing should not be measured as part of a general health
screen.
4. Patients who are pregnant/taking an oral contraceptive pill/taking Metformin can have falsely
low vitamin B12 levels.
5. Vitamin B12 stores last over three years. Therefore, if a normal vitamin B12 result has been
obtained in the previous six months, a further vitamin B12 test will not be processed unless
discussed with a haematology consultant.
6. Folate stores last for a shorter period of time. Therefore, repeat folate testing may be
necessary if one of the indications below is met.
7. Patients on parenteral vitamin B12 replacement therapy do not require repeat vitamin B12
measurement unless blood counts or neurological symptoms fail to improve.
8. Patients on folic acid replacement therapy do not require repeat folate measurement unless
blood counts fail to improve.
9. The minimum interval for repeat testing of vitamin B12 and folate is generally 90 days.
However, if appropriate new clinic details are provided, retesting may be performed within 90
days.

Department of Health Recommendations – Taking Blood Cultures
Blood cultures should only be collected by members of staff (medical, nursing, healthcare assistant, or
phlebotomist) who have been trained in the collection procedure and whose competence in blood culture
collection has been assessed.

Always make a fresh stab
In patients with suspected bacteraemia, it is generally recommended that two sets of cultures be taken at
separate times from separate sites.
Do not use existing peripheral lines/cannulae or sites immediately above peripheral lines. (If a central line
is present, blood may be taken from this and from a separate peripheral site when investigating potential
infection related to the central line; the peripheral vein sample should be collected first.)
Identify a suitable venepuncture site before disinfecting the skin.
Avoid femoral vein puncture because of the difficulty in adequate skin cleansing and disinfection.

Thoroughly disinfect the skin before inserting the needle
Thoroughly cleanse the patient’s skin before venepuncture.
Use soap and water to clean visibly soiled skin and then clean your own hands. Use a 2% chlorhexidine in
70% isopropyl alcohol impregnated swab to disinfect the patient’s skin and allow to dry.

Once disinfected, don’t touch the skin again
To avoid cross-contamination from the collector’s fingers (even when gloved), it is vitally important not to
palpate the site again once it has been disinfected.

Disinfect the culture bottle cap before transferring the sample
Ideally, remove the plastic cover immediately before collecting the sample; the top of the bottle will be
clean but not sterile. Disinfect the tops of the culture bottles with a 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl
alcohol impregnated swab. Allow the alcohol to fully evaporate before proceeding with bottle inoculation.
NB: The use of blood collection adapter caps without winged blood collection sets is not recommended. It
is not possible to accurately judge sample volume and there is the potential for possible backflow of
blood culture media into patient veins.
1. Skin preparation
Clean hands using correct hand hygiene technique (use of the World Health Organisation’s ‘5 moments of
hand hygiene’ or the NPSA ‘Clean you hands campaign’ is recommended).

Clean any visibly soiled skin on the patient with soap and water then dry.

Apply a disposable tourniquet (if applicable) and palpate to identify vein.

Clean skin with a 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol impregnated swab and allow to dry.

Do not repalpate skin following cleaning

If a culture is being collected from a central venous catheter, disinfect the access port with a 2%
chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol impregnated swab.
2.



Bottle preparation
Label bottles with appropriate patient information.
Ensure that barcodes on the bottles are not covered by additional labels and that any tear-off
barcode labels are not removed.
Clean the tops of culture bottles with a 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol impregnated swab
and allow to dry.
3. Sample collection - use either method A or B as follows:
A: NEEDLE AND SYRINGE METHOD

Clean hands again using correct hand hygiene technique (use of the World Health Organisation’s ‘5
moments of hand hygiene’ or the NPSA ‘Clean you hands campaign’ is recommended) or use
alcohol hand rub and apply clean examination gloves (sterile gloves are not necessary).

Gloves and apron are worn (in line with local policy). Personal protective equipment (PPE) is
disposed of correctly (in line with local policy) after use.

Insert needle. Do not palpate again after cleaning.

Collect sample and release tourniquet.

Cover the puncture site with an appropriate dressing.

If blood is being collected for other tests, always inoculate the blood culture bottles first.

Inoculate blood into culture bottles; do not change the needle between sample collection and

Inoculation; inoculate anaerobic culture first.

Discard needle and syringe in a sharps container.

Clean hands again using correct hand hygiene technique (use the World Health

Organisation’s ‘5 moment of hand hygiene’ or the NPSA ‘Clean Your Hands Campaign are
recommended).
B: WINGED BLOOD COLLECTION METHOD

Clean hands again using correct hand hygiene technique (use of the World Health Organisation’s ‘5
moments of hand hygiene’ or the NPSA ‘Clean you hands campaign’ is recommended) or use
alcohol hand rub and apply clean examination gloves (sterile gloves are not necessary).

Gloves and apron are worn (in line with local policy) Personal protective equipment (PPE) is
disposed of correctly (in line with local policy) after use.

Attach winged blood collection set to blood collection adapter cap.

Insert needle into prepared site. Do not palpate again after cleaning.

Place adapter cap over blood collection bottle and pierce septum.

Hold bottle upright and use bottle graduation lines to accurately gauge sample volume and collect
sample; inoculate aerobic culture first.

If blood is being collected for other tests, always collect the blood culture first.

Cover the site with an appropriate sterile dressing.

Discard winged blood collection set in a sharps container.

Clean hands using correct hand hygiene technique (use of the World Health Organisation’s ‘5
moments of hand hygiene’ or the NPSA ‘Clean you hands campaign’ is recommended) after
removing gloves.
4. Number and time of collection – General guide
Suspected sepsis or acute septic shock.
In cases of suspected sepsis or acute septic shock or in individuals with any prosthetic material in situ
(valve, hip etc), collect 2-3 separate venepunctures (two bottles each) immediately before starting
treatment.
Suspected line sepsis
Please ensure that a blood culture set is taken both peripherally and from the suspected line.
Infective endocarditis (IE) or chronically ill patients
In suspected Infective endocarditis (IE) or chronically ill patients, obtain three blood culture sets during the
first 1-2 hours of evaluation; if all are sterile 24 hours later, obtain three more sets. From patients who
have received antimicrobial agents within two weeks prior to admission, obtain two separate blood
cultures on each of three successive days.
Suspected bacteremia
For suspected bacteremia in patients already on antimicrobial therapy, if therapy cannot be suspended for
a few days, draw 2-3 cultures within the first 48 hours. Cultures should be taken immediately before the
next dose of antimicrobial agent if the patient is receiving intermittent parenteral therapy.
Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)
For fever of unknown origin (e.g., occult abscess, typhoid fever, or brucellosis), obtain two or three blood
cultures initially. Then 24-36 hours later, obtain two more cultures immediately before the expected
(usually afternoon) temperature elevation.
Sepsis of the newborn
One to two blood cultures usually suffice for diagnosing sepsis of the newborn. The physician should
determine the volume of blood. Inject 1-2mL into a paediatric bottle.
Blood culture for Mycobacterium sp.
Please refer to the TB section in this manual.
Special precautions:
Turnaround time:
5.
Incubation
Routine blood cultures are incubated for five days, unless the lab is notified to hold for a longer period
(e.g., when IE, brucellosis or systemic fungal infections such as histoplasmosis are suspected). The
routine 5-day incubation period is adequate for recovery of most yeasts (e.g., Candida species).
DO NOT COVER BOTTLE BARCODE AS THIS IS SCANNED AS PART OF THE ANALYTICAL
PROCESS

Ensure that the blood culture bottles have not exceeded their expiry date.

Sample is taken preferably before antimicrobial treatment is started.

Collect specimens as soon as possible after a spike of fever, except in endocarditis where timing is
less important.

Indicate if specific organisms are sought e.g. endocarditis.

Blood cultures should be transported to the laboratory and incubated within a maximum of 4 hours

Do not refrigerate.

Specimen collection:
Nasopharyngeal aspirate is the preferable specimen. Pernasal / nasopharyngeal swabs will suffice.
(Amies charcoal swab- Flexible twisted wire - blue cap,Available from the microbiology laboratory, Tel:
061-482255)
Cough Plates should not be used
A perinasal swab (Amies Charcoal - blue cap with flexible wire shaft) is inserted through a nostril and
advanced along the floor of the nose until it reaches the nasopharynx. It has been suggested that the
swab be held against the posterior nasopharynx for up to 30 seconds or until the patient coughs. In
practice, it is more likely that a patient will only be able to tolerate this for a few seconds.
Note: Sampling of nasopharyngeal secretions in patients with whooping cough may precipitate a
paroxysm of coughing and cause obstruction of the airways. Resuscitation equipment must be available if
whooping cough is suspected. The specimen collector should avoid exposure to direct coughs from the
patient.
Special precautions:
Turnaround time:
Nasopharyngeal exudate may be obtained using a suction catheter (No.8 French) inserted through the

Important notes:
Albumin is the principal binding protein for calcium. A decrease in serum/plasma albumin will lead to a fall
in albumin-bound calcium and a decrease in total calcium concentration and vice versa. Therefore serum
albumin should always be requested with serum calcium. Total serum calcium can be ‘adjusted’ to
‘correct’ for changes in serum albumin. This adjustment of total calcium is to that expected to be present
at an albumin concentration of 40 g/L. The adjustment equation used in this laboratory is as follows:
Adjusted calcium (mmol/L) = {(40 – albumin) x 0.02} + measured calcium.

Name:
EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) Antibodies
Laboratory:
Serology
Specimen type:
Gel Serum (Brown Top)
Special requirements and comments:
Note: The EBV serology profile is an expensive, labour-intensive test and should not be employed as the
‘front line’ test for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. In patients with symptoms compatible with
infectious mononucleosis, a positive Paul-Bunnell heterophile antibody test (Monospot - Haematology)
result is diagnostic, and no further testing is necessary.
Refer to: Monospot (Infectious Mononucleosis)
The EBV serology profile consists of three assays: EBV-CA IgG, EBV-CA IgM & EBNA-1 IgG
Turnaround time:
3 working days
Repeat testing Interval:
Once off for requests for EBV IgG status




Name:
eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate)
Laboratory:
Biochemistry
Specimen type:
Gel Serum (Brown Top)
Special requirements and comments:
The serum should be separated from the red blood cells within six hours of venepuncture; otherwise
substances are released from the red blood cells, which cause falsely raised serum creatinine
concentrations.
Note: calculation is based on the 4v-MDRD Formula and is only applicable to adults (i.e. patients greater
than 18 years old).
Turnaround time:
Urgent sample: 90 mins. UHL wards: 3 hours. GP: 4 working days.
Reference Interval:
Greater than 90 mL/min/1.73m2
Important notes on Estimated
GFR in adults using formulae:
(1) Estimated GFR is calculated using the 4v-MDRD Formula (with creatinine assay calibration
traceable to ID-MS).
(2) Estimates of GFR are unreliable in acute renal failure due to the kinetics of creatinine
accumulation.
(3) GFR estimates between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 do not indicate CKD unless there is other
laboratory/clinical evidence of disease.
(4) Estimated GFR should be multiplied by 1.212 for African-American patients.
IDMS-traceable MDRD Study Equation for serum creatinine reported in SI units
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (serum creatinine (µmol/L) x 0.011312)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if
female) x (1.212 if African American)
The IDMS-traceable MDRD Study equation is for laboratories that use creatinine methods that have been
calibrated to be traceable to IDMS.

Name:
Electrolytes
Laboratory:
Biochemistry
Specimen type:
Special requirements and comments:
Gel Serum (Brown Top)
Lithium Heparin Plasma (Green Top)
The electrolyte panel includes sodium, potassium.
Blood specimens for potassium assay must be collected free of haemolysis. The serum must be
separated within a period of two hours from venepuncture, since potassium is released from red blood
cells during the transport and storage of whole blood specimens thus causing a falsely raised serum
potassium concentration.
Primary Care Samples
There is usually a delay (of about 4-6 hours) in blood samples from Primary Care reaching the
Biochemistry Laboratory for processing. This delay can cause a falsely raised serum potassium
concentration, due to the release of intracellular potassium from red blood cells, during transport and
storage of whole blood.
Turnaround time:
Urgent sample: 90 mins. UHL wards: 3 hours. GP: 4 working days.
Reference Interval:
Minimum Retesting Interval:

• Faeces for Ova, Cysts and Parasites (OCP)
• Faeces for Clostridium difficile (C.diff) Diarrhoeal specimens only suitable for C diff. Specimens must be
delivered to the laboratory without delay as toxin degradation may occur with prolonged storage.
• Sellotape slide/perianal swab for detection of Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm)
• Schistosoma sp: Please refer to the urine section in the manual.
Specimen collection:
Routine PCR/sensitivity/OCP/ C. difficile toxin B gene test
• Fresh sample in a clean, sterile, leakproof container.
Faeces may also be collected from a sterile bedpan. However, if there is any contamination with urine,
residual soap, detergent, or disinfectant in the pan, the sample is unsatisfactory.
• A minimum of three specimens collected on alternate days (48 hrs apart) is recommended for a
complete OCP examination where parasite infestation is suspected as shedding of cysts and ova may be
intermittent.
• Specimens of faeces should be transported to the laboratory and processed as soon as possible,
because a number of important pathogens such as Shigella species may not survive the pH changes that
occur in faeces specimens which are not promptly delivered to the laboratory, even if refrigerated. C.
difficile toxin degradation may also occur.
• Please submit a separate sample to the Serology/Immunology Laboratory for virology testing.
• PLEASE NOTE: Specimens will not be processed for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter or E.coli
VTEC from patients who have been in-house >72 HOURS.
• *PLEASE NOTE: Specimens from patients < 2years of age are not routinely processed for C difficile.
• *Specimens from paediatric inpatients (2-16 years) in UHL ONLY will no longer be processed for C
difficile unless specifically requested by the paediatric consultants.
Perianal swab/sellotape slide
Sample between 22.00h and midnight, or early in the morning, before defecation or bathing.
• Sellotape slide Apply sellotape to the perianal region, pressing the adhesive side of the tape firmly
against the left and right perianal folds several times. A tongue depressor can be used to wrap the tape
around. Smooth the tape back on the slide, adhesive side down. Label slide with patient name and date of
birth
• Perianal swab - cotton-wool swab in dry container. Spread buttocks apart, and rub the moistened cotton
wool swab over the area around the anus, but do not insert into the anus. Place cotton wool swab back
into its container (no transport medium required). Ensure container is labelled appropriately. Occasionally,
an adult worm may be collected from a patient and sent in saline or water for identification.

Clostridoides difficile: All healthcare associated C.difficile isolates are sent for typing to the Public
Health England C.difficle Reference laboratory, Leeds General Infirmary. Those patients with identical
ribotypes who are epidemiologically linked have their isolates further typed (MLVA) to determine if cross
transmission may have taken place.
C. difficile positive and Toxin positive results- Results indicate C. difficile toxin is present; therefore
active C. difficile disease is likely. Review current antibiotics and stop if possible.
For symptomatic adult patients in the community, commence metronidazole 400 mgs PO TDS for 10-14
days and isolate with contact precautions.
For hospitalised patients, commence ORAL vancomycin 125mg qds for 10-14 days and isolate with
contact precautions. Contact Clinical Microbiology Team for advice if severe disease or

C. difficile and Toxin negative results (any setting): Results indicate C. difficile which carries the toxin
gene is present, however C. difficile toxin is NOT detected in stool. Active C. difficile disease is LESS
likely, but is not outruled. Isolate patient with contact precautions. Review current antibiotics and stop if
possible. If clinical features of active C. difficile disease present, commence metronidazole 400 mgs po
tds for 10-14 days, or ORAL vancomycin 125mg qds for moderate/severe disease. See hospital
antimicrobial guidelines for case severity definitions. Contact Clinical Microbiology Team for advice if

EDTA (Violet Top)
Special requirements and comments:
After 24 hours, WBC differential and red cell indices are affected by EDTA changes.
WBC differential, haemoglobin and red cell indices are affected by pregnancy.
Ensure samples are not taken from a drip site as this results in haemodilution of the sample.
Clotted EDTA samples will not be processed.
It is not technically possible to process cord blood, pleural, ascites, CSF fluid etc. on a haematology
analyser.
Automated white cell/red cell counts cannot be provided on such fluids

Name:
Ferritin
Laboratory:
Haematology
Specimen type:
Gel Serum (Brown Top)
Special requirements and comments:
Requests should be received by the laboratory within 8 hours of phlebotomy, add on tests within 24 hours
of phlebotomy.
Indications for Ferritin testing:
General principles
1. Measurement of vitamin B12, folate or ferritin should only be performed following clinical
assessment, and in the presence of one of the specific indications listed below.
2. Fatigue and tiredness are not indications for vitamin B12, folate or ferritin measurement.
3. Vitamin B12, folate and ferritin testing should not be measured as part of a general health
screen.
4. Patients who are pregnant/taking an oral contraceptive pill/taking Metformin can have falsely
low vitamin B12 levels.
5. Vitamin B12 stores last over three years. Therefore, if a normal vitamin B 12 result has been
obtained in the previous six months, a further vitamin B 12 test will not be processed unless
discussed with a haematology consultant.
6. Folate stores last for a shorter period of time. Therefore, repeat folate testing may be necessary
if one of the indications below is met.
7. Patients on parenteral vitamin B12 replacement therapy do not require repeat vitamin B12
measurement unless blood counts or neurological symptoms fail to improve.
8. Patients on folic acid replacement therapy do not require repeat folate measurement unless
blood counts fail to improve.
9. The minimum interval for repeat testing of vitamin B12 and folate is generally 90 days.
However, if appropriate new clinic details are provided, retesting may be performed within 90
days.
Indications for ferritin testing
1. Unexplained anaemia
2. Assessing response to iron therapy
3. Suspected haemachromatosis or unexplained liver disease
4. Assessment of iron stores in patients with suspected iron overload and/or hereditary
haemochromatosis

Specimen Requirements:
Specimen Collection:
All specimens
Note: Skin / scalp scrapings, nail scrapings and hair specimens are not suitable for routine bacteriological
investigation.
Scrapings / Hair should be placed in DERMAPAK Envelopes
(Contact Microbiology Laboratory at 482255)
This investigation is referred to Biomnis Laboratories Tel: +353 1 295 8545 and is restricted to
Dermatology Consultants
It is often helpful to clean the lesions of the skin or scalp (and sometime nail) with surgical spirit or 70%
alcohol prior to collection of samples as this improves the chances of detecting the fungus by microscopy
and also reduces the likelihood of contamination of subsequent cultures.
Prior cleaning is essential if greasy ointments or powders have been applied to the region.
Scalp
Specimens from the scalp are best obtained by scraping with a blunt scalpel. The contents should include
hair stubs, the contents of plugged follicles and skin scales. Hair may also be plucked from the scalp with
forceps (infected hairs are usually easy to remove in this way). Cut hairs are unsatisfactory as the focus of
infection is usually below or near the surface of the scalp.
Nail clippings
Nail clippings should be taken from any discoloured, dystrophic or brittle parts of the nail. These should be
cut as far back as possible from the free edge of the nail and include its full thickness, scrapings can also
be taken from beneath the nail to supplement the clipping sample.
Skin
Skin samples should be collected by scraping outwards from the edges of the lesions, with either a blunt
scalpel blade or with the edge of a glass microscope slide. The edge of the lesion is where there is likely
to be the most fungus.
Special precautions:
- Loose slides should not be used.
- Do not use fixatives.

Specimen collection:
 Please note there is no rationale for HVS sampling unless a discharge is present.
 Most episodes of Vaginal Discharge are physiological and empirical treatment for candidiasis and
Bacterial Vaginitis (BV), if suspected, is appropriate. Please note exceptions to this in notes at the
bottom of the decision tree.
 Gram stains on HVS specimens are used as a diagnostic tool for Bacterial Vaginosis (BV).
 If microbiological confirmation of BV is desired Gram stain only will be performed on HVS samples
received with clinical details of ‘suspect BV/suggestive of BV’ included on the request form (i.e. no
culture will be undertaken) as this can be used as a diagnostic tool for BV.
 If the clinical details of ‘suspect BV/suggestive of BV’ are not included on the request form a gram stain
will not be performed.
 Provision of appropriate clinical details will direct the laboratory’s testing repertoire (i.e. culture
and/or gram) and provide the best service for the patient. Clinical details such as pregnancy, recurrent
candidiasis (as defined in the decision tree), intra menstrual /post coital bleeding, pelvic pain, and
‘suspect BV/suggestive of BV’ allow us to test each specimen appropriately. If clinical details are not
provided on the request form, the specimen will not be processed.
 HVS samples processed in the laboratory for culture will not be cultured for gonorrhea as an
endocervical swab for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea PCR is the preferred sample type.
 Pre-insertion of Intrauterine device (IUD) / IUD in situ: An STI screen should be offered to all
women who are identified as being at risk of STIs if they are pre-insertion of an IUD or have an IUD in
situ; a single vulvovaginal or endocervical sample for Chlamydia / Gonorrhoea PCR is adequate. There
is no requirement to take routine High Vaginal Swabs for culture unless a discharge is present.
Specimens submitted with clinical details of ‘Pre-coil’ or ‘IUD / Coil in situ’ will not be processed for
culture. Provision of additional appropriate clinical details (as defined in the attached decision tree)
will direct the laboratory’s testing repertoire (i.e. culture and/or gram) and provide the best service for
the patient. Samples for Chlamydia / Gonorrhoea PCR may be taken using the Multi-Collect kit and
placed in the orange cap bottle containing sample transport buffer. See details of Swabs for
Microbiology and Virology Investigations in this user manual.
 The decision trees above are provided in an effort to illustrate the rationale behind this approach and
to assist in your clinical assessment and management of the patient
 The pH is a helpful aid for your diagnosis however, there are other clinical parameters outlined re.
discharge type, odour and patient history that will aid your decision to collect a HVS specimen and
inform your approach to clinical detail provision
 Please see HVS advisory memo reissued 2018.
 For detection of viruses: separate samples should be collected into appropriate transport media
Contact the Serology / Immunology laboratory at 061-482797
Cervical swabs
Cervix (endocervix): Wipe the cervix clean of vaginal secretion and mucus. Use a speculum without
lubricant - it may be toxic to certain bacteria. Under direct vision, gently compress the cervix with the
blades of speculum, and use a rotary motion with a culture swab. Obtain exudate from endocervical
glands. Alternatively, insert the swab into the cervical os, allow it to remain in place for a few seconds, and
remove it. Return the culture swab to the Amies transport medium with charcoal base or Abbott MultiCollect™ specimen collection kit
High vaginal swabs
After the introduction of the speculum, the swab should be rolled firmly over the surface of the vaginal
vault. The swab should then be placed in transport medium with charcoal.
Urethral swabs
Contamination with micro-organisms from the vulva or the foreskin should be avoided. Thin swabs are
available for collection of specimens. The patient should not have passed urine for at least 1 hour. For
males, if a discharge is not apparent, attempts should be made to “milk” exudate from the penis. The
swab is gently passed through the urethral meatus and rotated. Place the swab in transport medium with
charcoal.
Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs)
The entire device should be sent.
Rectal swabs
Rectal swabs are taken via a proctoscope. If a proctascope is not available consider blind swabs.

Additional information:
 Please test for syphilis in patients with genital ulcer disease (test may be negative if tested within 2
weeks of chancre, there is no facility for dark ground microscopy locally), generalised maculopapular
rashes, aseptic meningitis, bearing in mind the multiple possible clinical manifestations of syphilis.
 Routine syphilis, Hepatitis B and HIV serology should be offered to all patients getting a sexual health
screen as standard of care.
 Where Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) is detected via PCR, please request swabs for GC culture.
 Low vaginal swabs are discouraged because the presence of high numbers of commensal flora makes
them difficult to interpret
 Self taken vulval / vaginal swabs for chlamydia/ GC have better yield than urine in women.
 Maternity Patients: re gram staining on HVS samples from maternity patients Gram stain performed
only if Query bacterial vaginosis (?BV) is noted on request form as a clinical detail. Refer to memo

Name:
Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
Laboratory:
Biochemistry
Specimen type:
See special requirements and comments section
Special requirements and comments:
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) using Rapilose® solution
An OGTT need only be considered to establish a diagnosis of diabetes if blood glucose values fall into an
equivocal range (e.g. IFG or IGT) and is not necessary if the diagnostic criteria for diabetes are present.
OGTT is not necessary if the diagnostic criteria for Diabetes are present outside pregnancy. The OGTT is
a diagnostic procedure; therefore patients with a pre-existing Type 1 or 2 Diabetes do not require this test.
OGTT in pregnancy should be done at weeks 24-28.
The patient should consume their normal diet for 3 consecutive days prior to test. The patient should be
advised not to alter their diet prior to test. Perform OGTT after at least 3 days of unrestricted diet (> 150g
CHO daily).The patient should fast (no food or fluids except water) overnight (8-12 hours).
Procedure:
1) Confirm patient has fasted for at least 8-12 hours
2)
Collect first venous Blood sample (Fasting glucose) into Fluoride EDTA bottle
(Sarstedt, grey cap) and label this bottle with PID, date and time.
3)
Patient must drink the full content of the Rapilose OGTT solution pouch (300mL) over 5-10
minutes
4)
The patient must sit quietly during the test and refrain from smoking.
5)
1 hour later take a second venous Blood sample collected into a Fluoride EDTA bottle (grey
cap); label tube with PID, Date and Time
6)
2 hours post glucose drink collect third venous Blood sample (2 hr post prandial glucose) into a
Fluoride EDTA (grey cap); label tube with PID, Date and Time
7)
Refer to HSE 2010 Guidelines for the Management of Pre-gestational and Gestational Diabetes
Mellitus from Pre-conception to the Post natal period for the OGTT procedure and the
diagnostic interpretation of OGTT in pregnancy.
Rapilose® NDC Stock item: 12MX1013
Notes on Oral Glucose Preparations for OGTT:
 For oral glucose tolerance testing, the standard dose for an adult is one pouch of Rapilose®
OGTT Solution (300mL / 75g anhydrous glucose). However, it can be easily adjusted to
paediatric applications based on body mass.





The dose for children that weigh less than 43kg is 7mL (1.75g anhydrous glucose) per kg of body
weight. The total children's dose should not exceed 75g.
Each 300mL pouch of Rapilose® OGTT Solution contains exactly 75g anhydrous glucose, which
is the adult dose recommended by the World Health Organisation.
Rapilose® OGTT Solution is produced in a ready to drink format in a 300mL aluminium foil
pouch with a tamper evident twist off cap.
Rapilose® OGTT Solution is a pleasant tasting orange flavoured drink that is non-carbonated
and contains no colour additives. It is also gluten, lactose, fat, caffeine and alcohol free.
Rapilose® OGTT Solution has an 18 month shelf-life, when stored unopened at room
temperature
Polycal® Liquid (neutral or orange):

Polycal liquid may also be used as the 75 g glucose load for OGTT

This 75g load is prepared by mixing 113mL of Polycal® with 250-300mL of water.
Criteria for diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes in pregnancy
A diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made when one or more values are met or exceeded on the 75 g
OGTT in Pregnancy:

Fasting Glucose > 5.1 mmol/L

One hour glucose ≥ 10.0 mmol/L

Two hour glucose ≥ 8.5 mmol/L
Post natal Women with GDM should be offered advice on:
 Diet and lifestyle

Risk of GDM in subsequent pregnancies
 Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in future
 The need for 6-12 weeks postpartum and annual OGTT
Blood glucose monitoring in the postnatal period:
 Once the placenta is delivered, maternal blood glucose and insulin levels may rapidly return to
normal.

Insulin therapy should be discontinued immediately postpartum.
 Capillary blood glucose monitoring should be discontinued once blood glucose returns to normal
levels.

Overt type 1 or diabetes should be suspected and investigated if hyperglycaemia persists.
 A 75g OGTT, using the WHO criteria for the non-pregnant population should be performed at 612 weeks postpartum and yearly thereafter as an increased risk of developing diabetes and
cardiovascular disease exists.
 If normal these women should have lifelong screening for pre-diabetes or diabetes development
every 3 years
Note: Following delivery, women diagnosed with GDM should be screened for persistent Diabetes 6-12
weeks postpartum, as an increased risk of developing type 2 Diabetes, type 1 Diabetes and
cardiovascular disease exists. If normal these women should have lifelong screening for pre-diabetes or
diabetes development every 3 years
Turnaround time:
Reference Interval:
The waiting time for performing a glucose tolerance test in UHL (phlebotomy) is about one week. Result
available in laboratory on day of test
Criteria for diagnosis of Diabetes, IFG and IGT in the non-pregnant adult:
Procedure:
Similar as above but only need to collect venous blood in Fluoride EDTA bottles (grey cap) :
1)
2)
Fasting sample taken prior to glucose drink
Sample taken 2 hours post glucose drink
Label tubes with PID, Date and Time and send to Biochemistry as soon as possible.
*IFG & IGT have an increased risk of future diabetes and cardiovascular morbidity
 Advise on healthy eating, regular exercise and avoidance of obesity
 Check Fasting Blood Glucose annually
 Treat co-existing coronary risk factors aggressively, as are at increased risk of developing
cardiovascular disease.
The pregnant women who meet the above criteria are considered to have overt type 2 diabetes mellitus

Name:
Helicobacter pylori Stool Antigen
Laboratory:
Serology
Specimen type:
Fresh stool sample collected in a clean, sterile, leak-proof container.
Please submit samples in a standard universal container (white cap).
Special requirements and comments:
A minimum sample volume of 5g is required.
Samples should be submitted within 24 hours of collection.
Pre-treatment: Antimicrobials, proton pump inhibitors and bismuth preparations are known to suppress H.
pylori and ingestion of these prior to testing may give a false negative result. The aforementioned
compounds should be discontinued 2 weeks prior to sample collection.
Post-treatment: Testing to monitor the efficacy of eradication therapy should only be requested > 4 weeks
after completion of therapy.
As per ESPHGAN & NASPGHAN guidelines, testing for H pylori stool antigen in children and adolescents
(<18 years of age) is NOT recommended. The stool antigen test does not differentiate between H pylori
colonisation and H pylori infection. Endoscopic biopsy is the recommended diagnostic test for
investigation of H pylori disease.
Turnaround time:
7 working days
Reference interval:
Detected / Not Detected
Relevant interpretive comments are included on the report.
Repeat testing Interval:
The negative predictive value of the stool antigen test is >95%. Therefore, provided sample collection
complies with the pre and post treatment requirements, then there is no need to retest for H. pylori unless
there is an imperative clinical requirement. Treat as functional dyspepsia. Low dose PPI or H2A for one
month, then as required (BIA / PHE Guidelines).




Name:
Hepatitis Screen (Hepatitis A, B, C & E)
Laboratory:
Serology
Specimen type:
Gel Serum (Brown Top)
Special requirements and comments:
Testing for Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis E (HEV),
is recommended in patients in whom an abnormal liver chemistry profile (LCP) has been recorded,
assuming no other obvious cause, and in those displaying signs or symptoms of acute hepatitis.
Abnormal LCP can be defined as an increase of twice the upper limit of the normal (ULN) range.
Testing for HCV in those who do not necessarily have an abnormal LCP should be performed in
accordance with the National HCV Screening Guidelines (2017).
If at the time of presentation, the LCP abnormalities are known to be present for more than 6 months in an
immunocompetent individual, then testing for HBV and HCV only is reasonable (with reflex testing for
HDV if HBV infected).

Comment:
The Legionella urinary antigen test is for detection of Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 antigen and for
epidemiological investigations if antigen is detected. Culture is recommended to detect causative agents other
than L. pneumophilia serogroup 1.
Refer to Legionella Culture
Urinary antigen detection is a very convenient method of diagnosing Legionnaires’ disease. Antigen becomes
detectable soon after onset of symptoms and the test may remain positive for several weeks, even after other
tests have become negative. Antigen detection is a highly specific method (>99%) of diagnosing legionellosis, its
sensitivity being similar to that of culture (80-85%).

4. Mitogen Control (Violet cap)
Contact the clinical microbiology laboratory at Ext 2255 for same
For each patient collect 1ml of blood by venepuncture directly into each of the Quantiferon-TB Gold IT blood
collection tubes. Blood should be collected into the Nil tube (Grey) first then the TB1 Antigen tube (green),
followed by the TB2 (yellow) & finally the Mitogen tube (Violet).
As 1ml tubes draw blood relatively slowly, keep the tube on the needle for 2-3 seconds once the tube appears to
have completed filling, to ensure that the correct volume is drawn.
The black mark on the side of the tubes indicates the 1ml fill volume.
If a butterfly needle is being used to collect blood a purge tube should be used to ensure that the tubing is filled
with blood prior to the Quantiferon-TB Gold tubes being used.
Antigens have been dried onto the inner wall of the blood collection tubes so it is essential that the contents of the
tubes be thoroughly mixed with the blood.
Mix the tubes by turning the tube end-over-end 8-10 times or shaking the tubes for 5 seconds ensuring that the
entire inner surface of the tube has been coated with the blood.
Label tubes & the designated quantiferon request form noting date & time sample taken.
The tubes must be transferred to a 37°C incubator as soon as possible. Do not refrigerate or freeze the samples

Clinical Situation
Healthy asymptomatic individuals under 50
Use of TFTs when you
suspect Thyroid
Dysfunction
Use of TFTs for PRIMARY
Hypothyroidism
Monitoring
Use of TFTs in
SECONDARY
Hypothyroidism
Use of TFTs to monitor
subclinical
hypothyroidism in adults
Use of TFTs to monitor
subclinical
hyperthyroidism in adults
When to re-test healthy individuals with previous
normal TFTs
When to Test:
Symptoms suggestive of Hypothyroidism, especially
in symptomatic women of menopausal age (or > 50
years old)
Hyperthyroid symptoms
Recommendation
Screening for thyroid dysfunction in a
healthy adult population is not warranted
Not less than 3 years since a previous normal
test in healthy asymptomatic individuals
Patients stabilised on long-term T4 therapy
Annually
In stable patients, there may be no need to
alter thyroxine dosage for very minor
abnormalities in TFTs. Instead enquire about
non-compliance and whether there was an
intercurrent illness.
After a change in thyroxine dosage.
Do not re-check TFTs for at least 3 months.
Suspected new cases: Please discuss these cases
with your local chemical pathologist or
endocrinologist before commencing any treatment.
Patients stabilised on Thyroxine therapy.
This is because further endocrinologist and/or
laboratory evaluation is usually necessary.
Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism If treatment
is initiated see use of TFTs for primary
hypothyroidism monitoring
Perform annual TFTS.
*Note in patients with secondary
hypothyroidism due to pituitary disease the
TSH level should NOT be used to guide
treatment (as it is often low) and therefore the
Free T4 level should be used
Confirm within 3-6 months to exclude
transient causes of elevated TSH.
Subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism who are
TPO Antibody positive
TFTs checked annually
Subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism who are
TPO Antibody negative
TFTs checked every 3 years
These cases should be discussed with the chemical
pathologist or endocrinology to decide a
monitoring/treatment plan
If treatment is initiated see use of TFTs for
hyperthyroidism monitoring
If treatment not undertaken
Check TFTs every 6-12 months.


Please submit a blood sample for HIV testing to the Serology/Immunology Laboratory if
submitting a sputum sample for TB investigation.
Following a positive microscopy/ culture a repeat sample is recommended during treatment at 4-6
weeks to check for resistance (i.e. compliance with treatment).
Note 1: Routine culture and sensitivity does not include TB culture, the investigation must be requested.
Limitations

Certain rare, fastidious mycobacteria may not grow or may grow slowly in the BacTalert MP culture
medium used. If these fastidious atypical mycobacteria are suspected, alternative methods of isolation
or culture media, processing without decontamination or extended incubation may be required for
recovery. Examples include M.abscessus, M. haemophilum and M.malmoense. BacTalert culture
bottles are incubated at 35°C precluding the recovery of mycobacteria that require other incubation
temperatures (e.g. M.marinum, M.ulcerans, M.haemophilum). Recovery of such mycobacteria requires
additional incubation at appropriate temperatures. Clinical input and advice re appropriate sample
processing is recommended if these strains are suspected. Inclusion of appropriate clinical details on
request forms is essential to ensure correct sample processing.
Recovery of Mycobacteria is dependent on the quality of specimen collected and the number of
culturable organisms in the specimen. Collection over 3 consecutive days is recommended for
respiratory infection.NB: Please send samples to the Laboratory as soon as they are taken – do not wiat
to send all three samples together as overgrowth of commensals may compromise recovery of
Mycobacteria.

There is usually a delay (of about 4-6 hours) in blood samples from Primary Care reaching the Biochemistry
Laboratory for processing. This delay can cause a falsely raised serum potassium concentration, due to the
release of intracellular potassium from red blood cells, during transport and storage of whole blood.

Name:
Varicella Zoster (VZV) Antibodies (IgM)
Laboratory:
Serology
Special requirements and comments:
** Requests for investigation for chicken pox / shingles should be based on direct detection methods by PCR with
a viral swab of the vesicular fluid from the lesion. Direct detection of VZV DNA from vesicular fluid is the most
sensitive method of detection. Up to 50% of patients with primary acute varicella fail to produce detectable IgM
antibodies so a negative IgM does not exclude a diagnosis of chickenpox. Furthermore, VZV IgM testing is not
recommended for the diagnosis of shingles (Herpes Zoster) due to the difficulty of result interpretation**
VZV IgM testing is still available at the reference lab in cases where swabs of the lesion are not available. Testing
will be by arrangement only with the duty Microbiologist.

Haematology
Specimen type:
Gel Serum sample (Brown Top)
Special requirements and comments:
Requests should be received by the laboratory within 8 hours of phlebotomy, add on tests within 24 hours
of phlebotomy.
Relevant Clinical Details required.
General principles
1. Measurement of vitamin B12, folate or ferritin should only be performed following clinical
assessment, and in the presence of one of the specific indications listed below.
2. Fatigue and tiredness are not indications for vitamin B12, folate or ferritin measurement.
3. Vitamin B12, folate and ferritin testing should not be measured as part of a general health screen.
4. Patients who are pregnant/taking an oral contraceptive pill/taking Metformin can have falsely low
vitamin B12 levels.
5. Vitamin B12 stores last over three years. Therefore, if a normal vitamin B12 result has been
obtained in the previous six months, a further vitamin B12 test will not be processed unless
discussed with a haematology consultant.
6. Folate stores last for a shorter period of time. Therefore, repeat folate testing may be necessary if
one of the indications below is met.
7. Patients on parenteral vitamin B12 replacement therapy do not require repeat vitamin B12
measurement unless blood counts or neurological symptoms fail to improve.
8. Patients on folic acid replacement therapy do not require repeat folate measurement unless blood
counts fail to improve.
9. The minimum interval for repeat testing of vitamin B12 and folate is generally 90 days. However, if
appropriate new clinic details are provided, retesting may be performed within 90 days.
